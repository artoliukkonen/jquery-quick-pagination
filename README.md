jQuery Quick Pagination Plugin
==============================

There are probably hundreds if not thousands of jquery plugins out there that do some form of pagination.  However sometimes you don't need a ton of extra featrues such as ajax or filtering, etc.

I came across a very simple plugin made as a tutorial over at (jquery4u.com) http://www.jquery4u.com/tutorials/jquery-quick-pagination-list-items/#.UE4ZAaQj7MA

I had some changes I needed to make to use it, and I couldn't find a shared respository for it.  It doesn't seem to be closed source, my guess is just that the author didn't think it needed to be published.  I think it does so I am publishing my changes to it.  I don't believe this to be against any copyright or rules, but if so please let me know.
